# List of static site generators

## Introduction

For small homepages you don't need a CMS. A static site generators (SSG) is enough.

There far too many options ....

The list is long: [static-site-generator list a github](https://github.com/topics/static-site-generator)

The fun fact: Most people think a SSG needs to work on markdown files (instead of HTML) and provides no GUI. I think this is just the way many SSG work, but there are many more options to create a static site. Why not create a static site via a nice Web-GUI with a DB backend? You just need a final build-step which creates static files from the data stored in the database.
